# Road-Accident-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

The project "Multi-Dimensional Data Analytics of Road Accidents in India" focuses on
analyzing road accident data from across India using various data visualization and analytical
techniques to uncover key insights and patterns. The goal is to better understand the causes,
frequency, and distribution of road accidents with respect to factors like time, location, vehicle
type, and driver behavior. The analysis leverages tools such as Python, Pandas, and
Matplotlib, and presents findings through interactive visualizations and dashboards. This
project aids policymakers, traffic authorities, and researchers in identifying high-risk areas and
implementing data-driven strategies to enhance road safety in India.

**TOOLS & SKILLS USED**

- Python – Core programming language used for data processing and analysis.
- Pandas – For data cleaning, manipulation, and handling large datasets efficiently.
- NumPy – For numerical operations and array processing.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – For creating static visualizations and exploratory data analysis.
- Jupyter Notebook – For organizing code, visualizations, and insights in a readable format.

**DATA EXPLORATION STEPS**

- Data Collection: Gathered road accident datasets from official sources.
- Data Loading: Loaded data using Pandas for inspection.
- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.
- Data Preprocessing: Created new features and converted data types.
- Univariate Analysis: Explored individual variables using visualizations.
- Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis: Analyzed relationships between multiple factors.
- Geographical Visualization: Mapped accident data across Indian states.
- Time Series Analysis: Tracked accident trends over time.
- Outlier Detection: Identified unusual patterns and anomalies.
- Insights & Interpretation: Summarized key patterns and actionable findings.

**KEY INSIGHTS**

- High-Fatality States: States like Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra consistently report the highest number of accidents and fatalities.
- Time-Based Trends: Most accidents occur during peak traffic hours, especially between 6 PM to 9 PM, indicating increased risk during evening commutes.
- Monthly Patterns: A spike in accidents is observed during festive months and monsoon seasons, pointing to weather and travel activity as contributing factors.
- Vehicle Involvement: Two-wheelers and trucks are among the most frequently involved in road accidents.
- Age Factor: Young adults (18–35 years) are the most affected demographic, indicating the need for better driver education and awareness.
- Urban vs Rural: Rural areas often see higher fatality rates despite fewer accidents, suggesting poor emergency response and infrastructure.
- Cause Analysis: Speeding, drunk driving, and violation of traffic rules are major causes of accidents across most regions.
- State-Wise Variations: Some states have better accident-to-fatality ratios, implying more effective road safety measures or medical facilities.
